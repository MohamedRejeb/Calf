/**
 * A wrapper around the Android View WebView to provide a basic WebView composable.
 *
 * If you require more customisation you are most likely better rolling your own and using this
 * wrapper as an example.
 *
 * The WebView attempts to set the layoutParams based on the Compose modifier passed in. If it
 * is incorrectly sizing, use the layoutParams composable function instead.
 *
 * @param state The webview state holder where the Uri to load is defined.
 * @param modifier A compose modifier
 * @param captureBackPresses Set to true to have this Composable capture back presses and navigate
 * the WebView back.
 * @param navigator An optional navigator object that can be used to control the WebView's
 * navigation from outside the composable.
 * @param onCreated Called when the WebView is first created, this can be used to set additional
 * settings on the WebView. WebChromeClient and WebViewClient should not be set here as they will be
 * subsequently overwritten after this lambda is called.
 * @param onDispose Called when the WebView is destroyed. Provides a bundle which can be saved
 * if you need to save and restore state in this WebView.
 * @param client Provides access to WebViewClient via subclassing
 * @param chromeClient Provides access to WebChromeClient via subclassing
 * @param factory An optional WebView factory for using a custom subclass of WebView
 * @sample com.google.accompanist.sample.webview.BasicWebViewSample
